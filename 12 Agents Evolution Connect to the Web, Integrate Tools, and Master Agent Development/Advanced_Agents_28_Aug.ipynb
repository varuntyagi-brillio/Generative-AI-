Norman Pritchard had also achieved this feat at Paris 1900. 10 - Harmanpreet Singh was crucial to India winning a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics. Of the 15 goals that India scored, 10 of them came from the skipper's stick - eight penalty corners and two penalty strokes. Indian fans had mixed feelings after the Paris Olympics, where the nation won one silver and five bronze medals. This performance, though not surpassing Tokyo 2020, was better than Rio 2016. Despite improvements, India still needs grassroots support. The six fourth-place finishes point to potential future success, but challenges remain. After a record-breaking performance at the Tokyo Olympics, India aimed for a double-digit medal tally at the Paris Olympics 2024. With 117 athletes, the country ended up with six medals—one silver and five bronze—matching its London 2012 haul but falling short of Tokyo's seven medals. A nation woke up to words that many knew were coming and yet they crushed hearts, highlighting how sports is as brutal as it is beautiful and inspiring. With just four days remaining for the 2024 Olympics to conclude, India's sporting fans would concur on one thing: in Paris, the City of Love, India has had a heartbreaking campaign.\n"
